3.)
When working with this dataset, I noticed that very few of the company purposes from the scraped website had a TextBlob
Sentiment != 0. The generated company purposes also tended to mix past / present tense, as an indicator that it was
created with a program vs an authentic company site.

The lowest sentiment score observed in my dataset was for Reyes Inc, a company who specializes in artificial intelligence.
Digging into which word caused the low score, it ended up being the word "artificial", which TextBlob's sentiment scored
as a -0.6 polarity / 1 subjectivity. This is a poor categorization, as artificial intelligence should be interpreted
as an objective area of study. If we wanted to use TextBlob's sentiment function, we would need to update the corpora to
better handle our dataset of tech/finance companies.
